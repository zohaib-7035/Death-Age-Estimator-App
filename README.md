Life Expectancy Prediction App
Overview
This Streamlit application predicts life expectancy based on 19 health and economic indicators using a pre-trained machine learning model loaded from a .sav file (a1.sav). The app features an interactive interface for inputting data, a health tips section based on WHO guidelines, and a simple analysis of the prediction results.
Features

User Input: Collects 19 health and economic indicators, including a "Year" field (2000–2025).
Health Tips: Displays WHO-based health recommendations in an expandable section.
Model: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model (loaded via joblib) to predict life expectancy.
Prediction Analysis: Provides contextual feedback based on the predicted life expectancy (low, moderate, or high).
Output: Displays the predicted life expectancy in years upon clicking the "Predict Life Expectancy" button.

Requirements

Python 3.7+
Streamlit (pip install streamlit)
Joblib (pip install joblib)
NumPy (pip install numpy)
A pre-trained model file named a1.sav (must be uploaded to the environment, e.g., Kaggle or Streamlit Cloud)

Installation

Clone or download the repository to your local machine or environment.
Install the required dependencies:pip install streamlit joblib numpy


Ensure the pre-trained model file (a1.sav) is available in the same directory as the script or specify the correct path to the file.

Usage

Run the Streamlit app:streamlit run app.py


Open the provided local URL (e.g., http://localhost:8501) in a web browser.
Expand the "Health Tips Based on WHO Guidelines" section for health recommendations.
Enter values for the 19 input features:
Year: Year of data (2000–2025, default: 2023).
Adult Mortality: Probability of dying between 15 and 60 years per 1,000 population.
Infant Deaths: Number of infant deaths per 1,000 live births.
Alcohol Consumption: Per capita alcohol consumption (liters of pure alcohol).
Percentage Expenditure: Health expenditure as a percentage of GDP.
Hepatitis B (%): Hepatitis B immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%).
Measles: Number of measles cases per 1,000 population.
BMI: Average Body Mass Index of the population.
Under-five Deaths: Number of deaths of children under 5 years per 1,000 live births.
Polio (%): Polio immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%).
Total Expenditure: General government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure.
Diphtheria (%): Diphtheria immunization coverage among 1-year-olds (%).
HIV/AIDS: Deaths due to HIV/AIDS per 1,000 live births.
GDP: Gross Domestic Product per capita (in USD).
Population: Total population of the country.
Thinness 10–19 years: Prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents aged 10–19 (%).
Thinness 5–9 years: Prevalence of thinness among children aged 5–9 (%).
Income Composition of Resources: Human Development Index component for income (0 to 1).
Schooling (years): Average years of schooling.

File Structure

app.py: The main Streamlit application script.
a1.sav: The pre-trained machine learning model file (must be provided by the user).
README.md: This documentation file.

Deployment
To deploy the app on Streamlit Cloud or another platform:

Upload the script (app.py) and the model file (a1.sav) to the platform.
Ensure the requirements.txt file includes:streamlit
joblib
numpy


Deploy the app following the platform's instructions (e.g., link a GitHub repository for Streamlit Cloud).

Notes

The model (a1.sav) must be trained on a dataset with 19 features, including the "Year" feature, to ensure compatibility.
Input values should be realistic and within the specified ranges (e.g., percentages between 0 and 100, non-negative numbers for most fields, year between 2000 and 2025).
The analysis section provides general feedback based on the prediction: 
< 60 years: Low, suggests improving healthcare, nutrition, and education.
60–75 years: Moderate, indicates some risk factors.

75 years: High, suggests a healthy environment.





Limitations

Prediction accuracy depends on the quality and relevance of the pre-trained model (a1.sav).
The app includes basic input validation (e.g., ranges for percentages and year) but does not validate for realistic combinations of inputs.
The model file must be available in the environment for the app to function.
The health tips are general and based on WHO guidelines; they are not tailored to specific inputs.
